# Frame

Frame is a very small CSS framework that takes heavy inspiration from my other framework called Nox. I originally stated this project because I got a bit bored and wanted to brush up on my skills a bit, but now it's turned into a bit more of a serious project.

The project is written in SCSS and uses modern web features. It's not perfect, and I'm sure it breaks in many places, but this is mostly a learning experience for me.

Contributions to the project that add features or changes to the CSS are to be made using Pull Requests. I've started to do this on private personal projects and I prefer it this way. The beginning of Hacktoberfest definitely spurred this decision on as well.

## Hacktoberfest

Hello! If you've found this repo from the Hacktoberfest topic on the repository, welcome! If you wish to contribute, please make sure that it is either a meaningful improvement or a feature addition. **Use comments**, and follow as best you can the way that I have written the CSS thus far.

Contributions are welcome, though I don't know how many I may actually get.
